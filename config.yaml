# =====================================================
# Ceph RGW Multisite Monitor — Configuration
# =====================================================
# This tool uses radosgw-admin CLI on the local host.
# It MUST run on a Ceph admin/mon node with cluster access.
#
# NO configuration is required for basic operation.
# The tool will auto-discover everything from the cluster.
#
# The options below are all OPTIONAL.
# =====================================================

# --- Collection interval (seconds) ---
# How often to collect sync data from all zones.
collection_interval: 60

# --- Optional: REST API for bucket stats ---
# By default, bucket stats are fetched via radosgw-admin CLI.
# Set this to true to query secondary zone RGW endpoints directly
# via the Admin REST API for their bucket stats. This can be useful
# when the CLI --rgw-zone flag doesn't return remote zone stats
# (depends on cluster configuration).
#
# When enabled, access_key and secret_key are required.
use_rest_for_bucket_stats: true

# --- RGW Admin credentials (only needed if use_rest_for_bucket_stats: true) ---
# Create with:
#   radosgw-admin user create --uid=rgw-monitor \
#     --display-name="RGW Monitor" \
#     --caps="buckets=read;metadata=read;usage=read;zone=read"
access_key: "xxxxxx"
secret_key: "xxxxxxx"

# --- SSL verification (for REST API calls) ---
verify_ssl: false

# --- API server bind settings ---
